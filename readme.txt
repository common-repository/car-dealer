Uses my plugin, and childtheme along with a few other existing Wordpress plugins to create a Used Car Dealership

== Description ==

Displays your automobile inventory using the default Wordpress installation. Important: Theme TwentyTen must be loaded on your site.

== Installation ==

My demo site consists of four files: Car Dealer plugin, Twentytenchild theme located at my developement site, Cimy Header Image Rotator plugin and Exclude Pages plugin.<br /> 
1. Download the Car Dealer plugin from this site.<br /> 
2. Download the childtheme file from my <a href="http://wpwebdesignmadesimple.com/">Developement Site</a>.<br />
4. Install and activate the childtheme.<br />
5. Install and activate the Car Dealer plugin.<br />
7. Install and activate the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cimy-header-image-rotator/">Cimy Header Image Rotator</a>. To place the images in the header, follow the Cimy Header Image Rotator instructions. Use 940x198 to make use of the entire header.<br />
8. Install and activate <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/exclude-pages/">Exclude Pages</a> This is used to hide page titles ("Edit Car Single" and "Detail Display"). Toggle the checkbox in Page > Edit mode per the plugin instructions.<br />
Note: All pages are published when the plugin is activated. Don't forget to unpublish the "Upload" and "Edit" pages prior to logging off!<br />

Sample data is included which can be deactivated by marking the records "Sold" on the edit page. When you sell a car and mark it sold on the Edit page, the image is removed from the Inventory page and the header.<br />
